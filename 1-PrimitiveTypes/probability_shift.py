# The you shift the probability is by making multiple calls
# to the generator and finally once u are able to represent
# the number of outcomes with the nearest numbers of
# sample space then the next thing to do is to
# have a result that is within the number of outcomes
# for eg [1,2,3,4] but n = 3 so u have make sure ure
# results are less than 3.
# since the numbers can be denoted with log2(n) bits
# we make log2(b-a+1) calls so it is
# O(log2(b-a+1))
